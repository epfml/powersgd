# PowerSGD

Practical Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Optimization

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVxSu7KGtHw)

Abstract:
We study gradient compression methods to alleviate the communication bottleneck in data-parallel distributed optimization. Despite the significant attention received, current compression schemes either do not scale well or fail to achieve the target test accuracy. We propose a new low-rank gradient compressor based on power iteration that can i) compress gradients rapidly, ii) efficiently aggregate the compressed gradients using all-reduce, and iii) achieve test performance on par with SGD. The proposed algorithm is the only method evaluated that achieves consistent wall-clock speedups when benchmarked against regular SGD with an optimized communication backend. We demonstrate reduced training times for convolutional networks as well as LSTMs on common datasets.


## Reference implementation

This is a reference implementation for the PowerSGD algorithm.

Installation:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/epfml/powersgd.git
```

Usage:

```diff
+ from powersgd import PowerSGD, Config, optimizer_step

  model = torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
  params = list(model.parameters())
  optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(params, lr=0.1)

+ powersgd = PowerSGD(params, config=Config(
+     rank=1,  # lower rank => more aggressive compression
+     min_compression_rate=10,  # don't compress gradients with less compression
+     num_iters_per_step=2,  #   # lower number => more aggressive compression
+     start_compressing_after_num_steps=0,
+ ))

  for each batch:
      loss = ...
-     optimizer.zero_grad()
      loss.backward()
-     optimizer.step()
+     optimizer_step(optimizer, powersgd)
```

## Differences with the paper version

The version in this code base is a slight improvement over the version in the PowerSGD paper.
It looks a bit like Algorithm 2 in [this follow-up paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01425.pdf).

We found that there are two ways to control the approximation quality in PowerSGD: the first is the 'rank' of the approximation, and the second is the 'number of powerSGD iterations' in between gradient steps, while keeping the rank 1. Because the cost of orthogonalisation grows as $O(\text{rank}^2)$, increasing the rank can become inefficient, leaving changing the number of iterations as the best option.

In the original PowerSGD paper, more iterations only improves the quality of the rank-k approximation, as the approximation converges to the "best rank k approximation". In the [follow-up paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01425.pdf), intermediate results from these rank 1 power iterations are all used and communicated, effectively increasing the rank as the number of iterations grows.

In the original PowerSGD paper, we used two iterations per SGD step (a left and a right iteration). In this setting, there is not much of a difference. The difference appears when you use more power iteration steps per SGD step.



## PyTorch implementation
PyTorch features an implementation of PowerSGD as a [communucation hook](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/ddp_comm_hooks.html) for `DistributedDataParallel` models.
Because of the integration with DDP, the code is more involved than the code in this repository.
## Research code

Research code for the experiments in the [PowerSGD paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13727) is located under [paper-code](./paper-code/README.md).
